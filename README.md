# busca-cinema

Busca Cinema (or Find A Theater, translated from portuguese) is a simple app to show the current movies on theaters and its sessions' informations such as rooms, time, 3D, 2D, subtitled, etc.

Initially it's using an specific API that only fetches data from Fortaleza city in Brazil. The future idea is to expand it making it useful worldwide. But for instance, this is just a sample of what it can do.
