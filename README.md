# busca-cinema

Busca Cinema (or Find a Theater, translated from portuguese) is a simple app to show the current movies on theaters and its sessions' informations such as rooms, time, 3D, 2D, subtitled, etc.

For while it's divided into two branches:

* `master` only for my city (Fortaleza, Brazil)
* `feature/find-a-theater` for cities all over Canada

## The backend
It's another project that I also keep [here](https://github.com/Jefferson227/busca-cinema-backend) on GitHub.

## The app
Here is the app running https://buscacinema.com (the brazilian version) if you want to check this out.

Here is the link for the canadian version: https://find-a-theater.firebaseapp.com
